Game Rules
=========

"Cruce" is a game similar to Whist. The game has the following elements:

# The deck

The card deck consists of 24 different cards:
* __4 suits__ whose names vary with the region you are playing. I know them as
  Bell, Leaf (or green), Acorn and Heart (or red). For now, none of this colors 
  is superior to another. 
* Well Known Deck representation: Clubs for Bell, Spades for (Green) Leaf,
  Diamonds for Acorn, Hearts remains unchanged.
* __6 values__ of each suit: II, III, IV, IX, X and A (ace).

# The game board
The number of players in a game is not fixed. It can be carried with 2, 3 or 4
players. In the first 2 cases, the game is an individual one (we will say that
the players form one member teams) while in the last case, it will be played in
2 teams of 2 players (the opposite positioned players will form a team).

# The game

A game consists of more __rounds__ and it ends when one of the teams reaches a
certain score. The score's value is fixed at the start of the game, being
usually 11, 15 or 21. To end a game, it is necessary that there must be a gap of
2 game points among the player who crossed the point limit and opponent.
Otherwise, the game will continue until this constraint is fulfilled.

# The round

A round has the following stages:

* Cards distrubtion will take place by dealer.
    1. In a game with 4 players (it will be called game of four), every player
       will get 6 cards.
    2. In a game with 3 players, every player will get 8 cards.
    3. In a game witn 2 players, every player will get 8 cards and 8 cards
       remain on the table (Cards face down).

* Every player, counting clockwise from the first who recived the cards, will
  place a bid. The dealer should be the last to place the bid. The bidding
  process will be described later.
* After the bidding ends, the game starts. The winner of the bidding is the one
  who chooses the trump and will deal the first card (it must be a trump). 
* The winner of a round is the one who starts the next round, by placing a card
  on the table.
* When the players have no more cards (note that all the players will always
  have the same number of cards), each player's score is computed.
* The game proceeds to the next round, until the ending constraints are
  fulfilled.


# The bidding

Every player says "how many bid points" he thinks will make (this is called a 
bid). The one who has the largest bid wins the bidding. Now, let's what means to
make __one, two etc__.
For every "one" it is necessary to gain 33 points. So, to make _one_ you will
need __33__ points, to make _two_ - __66__ points, _three_ - __99__,
_four_ - __132__, _five_ - __165__, _six_ - __198__(I doubt you will ever make 6).
If the team which won the bidding does not gain enough points compared to its
bid, the points will be subtracted from its score. Let's see an example:
We are playing a game of four, and the score is 6 - 8. The bidding is won by a
player of the first team, who said two. At the end of the round, the first team 
gains only 64 card points and the second one, the rest of 56 card points. The
score after this round will be 4 - 9. The game goes on and the first team wins
the bidding with two. If at the end of the round the first team has 102 card
points and the second one 18 card points, the score will be 7 - 9. Note the
difference from whist, where if you do not fulfill the bid, your score 
decreases. Also, here is only one bet for every round. It is possible not to bid
(or to bid 0).

# The points

* II is worth 2 card points
* III, 3 card points
* IV, 4 card points
* IX, 0 card points
* X, 10 card points
* ACE, 11 card points
* Bid points - Choose by player at the start of every round
* Score points - Tells the current score point of player, (Game Points - Score
  Points) tells how much more Score points
  required to win the game.
* Game points - Choose by player to win the game


There are also some card combinations that may bring bonus points. If a player
has in hand a III and a IV of the same suit, they form a __call__. This is worth
20 or 40 card points, if the suit is trump. To make a call, it is necessary that
the player who owns it to be the first in that round and to put on the table one
of the two elements (the III or the IV).

# The hand

The game of two will be treated separately. Now, the game of 3 and 4 will be
described.
When a player puts a card of value V and suit S, all other players must put
cards of same suit. If a player does not have a card of suit S, it must put a
trump. If he has not any trump either, he can put whatever he likes. Also, a
player must put a card with a value V' > V, if he has one. Otherwise, he can put
anything. If a trump was played, the rules are a little bit more complicated.

Let's suppose I am the third player. The first player has put a bell of IV (the
trump is leaf). I have in hand the ace and II of bell. Normally, I should put
the ace, but the second player has no bell and he must put a leaf (the trump).
He puts the III of leaf. Now, the value rule for bells stops and I can put the
II of bell. If the fourth player has a IV of leaf and a II of bell, he must
place the IV of leaf.

Another formulation of the value rule is: at every moment, a player must put a
card that will win the round, if possible.

# Who wins the round?

If the trump was not played, the round is won by the player who put the card
with the highest value and the suit of the first card.
If the trump was players, the round is won by the player who put the trump with
the higest value.
The player who wins the round will start the next one.

# The game of two

In a game of two there is no value or color rule as long as there are cards
facing down on the table. Also, after putting a card, each player will take
another on from the table, while possible.


This are the basics of a game of "cruce". Here are some keywords:
* Game
* Game table
* Player
* Score
* Round
* Bid
* Tromp

Now, it is time for a resume:
In a game of "cross" will be played as many rounds as necessary for a team to
win. In every round, each player gets a number of cards, depending on the number
of players. After all players saw their cards, a bidding takes place, which is
won by the player who bids the most. The winner chooses the tromp and starts the
first round. There will be a fixed number of hands, equal with the number of
cards each player gets. At the end of all hands, the points are counted and the
score is updated.
